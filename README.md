# UPM_MLLB_II
Final project of the course Deep Learning at Polytechnic University of Madrid.

As a problem, I chose a Computer vision problem. The main goal was to classify traffic signs (german traffic signs - dataset from Kaggle).

The purpose of the project was to try different deep learning models (feed-forward neural network, recurrent neural network, convolutional neural network, transfer learning and so on) and implement simple experiments with it to get better understanding of the way it works.
