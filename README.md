# UPM_MLLB_II
The final project of the "Machine Learning" course at the Polytechnic University of Madrid

As a problem, I chose the Computer vision problem. The main goal was to classify traffic signs (german traffic signs - dataset from Kaggle).

The purpose of the project was to try different deep learning models (feed-forward neural network, recurrent neural network, convolutional neural network, transfer learning and so on) and implement simple experiments with it to get better understanding of the way it works.
